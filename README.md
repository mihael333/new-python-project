Import Modules: The script imports the time and sys modules to enable timing and system functionality, respectively.

Initialize Variables: It initializes two variables, waiting and waitingIncreasing, to control the animation.

Try-Except Block: The script wraps the main code in a try-except block to handle a keyboard interruption (Ctrl+C) gracefully.

Infinite Loop: Within the infinite while True loop:

It prints a variable number of spaces (' ' * waiting) before printing a string of "#" characters ('########'). The number of spaces increases or decreases to create the bouncing effect.
It pauses for a short duration using time.sleep(0.2) to control the animation speed.
It updates the number of spaces (waiting) based on whether the animation is currently increasing or decreasing. Once the number of spaces reaches either 1 or 10, it changes the direction of animation.
KeyboardInterrupt Handling: If a KeyboardInterrupt is raised (e.g., when the user presses Ctrl+C to interrupt the animation), the script exits gracefully using sys.exit().
